Debuting a song at an awards show is not a common thing in the K-Pop industry, which in turn generated much buzz for TWICE. If TWICE's <a class="mainp" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO0iwx3PUHo">performance</a> garnered enough views on YouTube, they would release the song officially, which happened quite quickly.</p>
